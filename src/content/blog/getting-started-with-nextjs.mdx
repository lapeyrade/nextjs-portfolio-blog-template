# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 represents a significant leap forward in React development, introducing powerful new features that make building web applications more intuitive and performant than ever before.

## What's New in Next.js 15?

The latest version of Next.js brings several exciting improvements:

### App Router (Stable)
The App Router is now stable and provides a more intuitive way to organize your application. It's built on React Server Components and supports:

- **Layouts**: Shared UI that maintains state across navigation
- **Server Components**: Components that render on the server by default
- **Streaming**: Progressive rendering for better performance

### React Server Components
Server Components allow you to render components on the server, reducing the JavaScript bundle size sent to the client:

```jsx
// This component runs on the server
async function BlogPost({ slug }) {
  const post = await getPost(slug)
  
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </article>
  )
}
```

## Building Your First App

Let's create a simple Next.js 15 application:

1. **Create a new project**:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest my-app
   cd my-app
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Create your first page** in `app/page.tsx`:
   ```tsx
   export default function Home() {
     return (
       <main>
         <h1>Welcome to Next.js 15!</h1>
         <p>This is your first page.</p>
       </main>
     )
   }
   ```

## Key Benefits

- **Performance**: Automatic optimizations and code splitting
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading and excellent error messages
- **SEO-Friendly**: Server-side rendering out of the box
- **Full-Stack**: Built-in API routes and database integration

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 makes it easier than ever to build modern web applications. With its improved App Router, Server Components, and enhanced performance, it's an excellent choice for your next project.

Whether you're building a simple blog or a complex e-commerce platform, Next.js 15 provides the tools and flexibility you need to succeed.
